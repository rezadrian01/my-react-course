# React Course Source Code by Maximilian Schwarzmüller

This repository contains all the source code I obtained from a React course on Udemy by Maximilian Schwarzmüller. Although I followed the course material, I wrote the code myself. The repository is organized into various branches, each representing a different section of the course.

## Branch Structure

- `main`: The main branch containing the initial setup and basic code.
- `section-1`: Code for Section 1 of the course.
- `section-2`: Code for Section 2 of the course.
- `section-3`: Code for Section 3 of the course.
- ... (continue as needed for each section)
